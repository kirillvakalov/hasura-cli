# @kirillvakalov/hasura-cli

An npm package that automatically installs and wraps **Hasura CLI binary** in isolated manner, so you can use it in your project without needing to install it globally.

The package is automatically published (always up-to-date) when a new version of Hasura CLI is released.

This work is significantly inspired by the [hasura-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hasura-cli) package.
